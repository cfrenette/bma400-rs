### About the Sensor (from the manufacturer)
#### Basic Description
12 bit, digital, triaxial acceleration sensor with smart on-chip motion and position-triggered interrupt features.

#### Key features
- Small Package Size 
  - LGA package (12 pins), footprint 2mm x 2mm, height 0.95 mm
- Ultra-low power
  - Low current consumption of data acquisition without compromising on performance (< 14.5 ÂµA with highest performance)
- Programmable functionality
  - Acceleration ranges Â±2g/Â±4g/Â±8g/Â±16g
  - Low-pass filter bandwidths = (0.24/0.48)*ODR up to a max. output data read out of 800Hz
- On-chip FIFO
  - Integrated FIFO on sensor with 1 KB
- On-chip interrupt features
  - Auto-low power/Auto wakeup
  - Activity/In-activity
  - Step Counter (overall device current consumption 4ÂµA)
  - Activity Recognition (Walking, Running, Standing still)
  - Orientation detection
  - Tap/double tap
- Digital interface
  - SPI (4-wire, 3-wire)
  - IÂ²C, 
  - 2 interrupt pins
- VDDIO voltage range: 1.2V to 3.6V
- RoHS compliant, halogen-free

#### Typical applications
- Step Counting with ultra-low current consumption for extensive battery lifetime
- Advanced system power management for mobile applications and (smart) watches
- Fitness applications / Activity Tracking
- Tap / double tap sensing
- Drop detection for warranty logging
- Window/door measurements for climate control and alarm systems
- IoT applications powered by coin cell driven batteries, requiring <1ÂµA and auto-wakeup
functionality
